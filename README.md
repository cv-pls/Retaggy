Retaggy
=======

Helps burninating and ratgging tags on Stack Overflow.

Usage
-----

### Burninate

1. Open up a search page which contains the tag you want to burninate. E.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php+find (set the number of results per page to 50 for extra burninating fun)
2. Click the Retaggy icon in the addressbar
3. Type the tag that needs to be burninated
4. Click FIRE!

Now all search results will be opened in tabs and the tag will be burninated. When there is only one tag the tab will stay open and the burnination process will have to be taken care of manually (i.e. retag it).

Browser support
---------------

Currently it only supports Chrome stable.

Warning
-------

Be careful when burninating tags using this plugin since it will go through the entire search results list and start to burninate the tags automatically. Don't screw up!

Todos / bugs
------------

- Make the UI shiny
- Sometimes when SO it too slow the tags don't get deleted
- Make everything less error prone
- FF version?
